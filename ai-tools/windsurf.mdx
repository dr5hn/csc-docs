Configure Windsurf's Cascade AI assistant to help you write and maintain documentation. This guide shows how to set up Windsurf specifically for your documentation workflow.

## Prerequisites

- Windsurf editor installed
- Access to your documentation repository

## Workspace rules

Create workspace rules that provide Windsurf with context about your documentation project and standards.

Create `.windsurf/rules.md` in your project root:

````markdown
# Technical writing rule

## Project context

- This is a documentation project using modern documentation platform
- We use MDX files with YAML frontmatter  
- Navigation is configured in a central configuration file
- We follow technical writing best practices

## Writing standards

- Use second person ("you") for instructions
- Write in active voice and present tense
- Start procedures with prerequisites
- Include expected outcomes for major steps
- Use descriptive, keyword-rich headings
- Keep sentences concise but informative

## Required page structure

Every page must start with frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Clear, specific title"
description: "Concise description for SEO and navigation"
---
```

## Documentation components

### Callouts

- `<Note>` for helpful supplementary information
- `<Warning>` for important cautions and breaking changes
- `<Tip>` for best practices and expert advice  
- `<Info>` for neutral contextual information
- `<Check>` for success confirmations

### Code examples

- When appropriate, include complete, runnable examples
- Use code groups for multiple language examples
- Specify language tags on all code blocks
- Include realistic data, not placeholders
- Use request/response examples for API docs

### Procedures

- Use step components for sequential instructions
- Include verification steps when relevant
- Break complex procedures into smaller steps

### Content organization

- Use cards for highlighting content
- Wrap images in frame components with descriptive alt text

## API documentation requirements

- Document all parameters with parameter fields
- Show response structure with response fields
- Include both success and error examples
- Use expandable sections for nested object properties
