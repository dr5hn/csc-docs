## Understanding the Workflow

Your change request goes through several stages:

### Status Meanings

| Status | Description | What Happens Next |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| **📝 Draft** | You're still working on it | Complete and submit when ready |
| **⏳ Pending** | Submitted and awaiting review | Community and admins will review |
| **✅ Approved** | Change accepted by reviewers | Queued for incorporation into database |
| **❌ Rejected** | Change not accepted | Check feedback and consider resubmitting |

### Incorporation Tracking

Once approved, your changes enter the **Incorporation System**:

| Incorporation Status | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **⏳ Pending** | Approved but not yet in main database |
| **🔄 Incorporated** | Successfully added to main database |
| **✅ Verified** | Confirmed present after database sync |
| **⚠️ Missing** | May have been overwritten during sync |
| **🔍 Conflicted** | Data conflict detected |
