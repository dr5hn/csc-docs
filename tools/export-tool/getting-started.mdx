</Info>

What you can do with your 3 free credits:
- Export all countries in JSON format (1 credit) + export all states in JSON format (2 credits) = 3 credits
- Export countries in CSV format for spreadsheet analysis (1 + 1 = 2 credits)
- Export cities data in JSON format (3 credits)

1. Log into your account
2. Click "Create New Export"
3. Under "Datasets," select **Countries**
4. You'll see "1 credit" cost indicator

<Tip>
**Start Simple**: Choose 4-5 essential fields for your first export to see how the system works.
