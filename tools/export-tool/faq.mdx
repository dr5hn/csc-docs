<Accordion title="How do I integrate exports with my application?">
Integration depends on your chosen format and technology stack:

**Web Applications (JSON):**
```javascript Frontend Integration
// Load and cache data
const geoData = await fetch('/data/export.json').then(r => r.json());

// Create lookup maps for performance
const countryMap = new Map(geoData.countries.map(c => [c.iso2, c]));
const stateMap = new Map(geoData.states.map(s => [s.state_code, s]));

// Use in components
function CountryDropdown() {
  return (
    <select>
      {geoData.countries.map(country => (
        <option key={country.iso2} value={country.iso2}>
          {country.emoji} {country.name}
        </option>
      ))}
    </select>
  );
}
```

**Database Integration (SQL):**
```bash Database Import
# PostgreSQL
psql -d mydb -f csc_export.sql

# MySQL
mysql -u user -p mydb < csc_export.sql

# SQLite
sqlite3 mydb.db < csc_export.sql
```

**Data Analysis (CSV):**
```python Python/Pandas
import pandas as pd

# Load data
countries = pd.read_csv('countries.csv')
states = pd.read_csv('states.csv')

# Analysis
regional_stats = countries.groupby('region').agg({
    'population': 'sum',
    'gdp': 'mean'
})
```

**Configuration (YAML):**
```yaml Kubernetes Config
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: geo-config
